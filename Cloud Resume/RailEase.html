              <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
              <P>In highly populated and urban area, public transport, especially rail transport like the LRT, MRT, Monorail, and others, are important and in higher demand among consumers. Nevertheless, passengers have not yet been exposed to applications with compact features and Malaysian public transportation services and facilities are still lacking in quality. Introducing 'RailEaseâ€™, our all-in-one rail transportation app. With it, you can book ticket, check schedules, get priority seats and get real-time train information right at your fingertips. Technology is advancing, and the word IoT is gaining popularity these days. IoT stood for Internet of Things and was first proposed by Kevin Ashton in 1999. With the help of this technology structure, it can help us achieve our objective of improving our rail transport service infrastructure in Malaysia. We need to review the existing public railway system apps with the aim of identifying areas for improvement in order to enhance overall customer satisfaction and experience, design and develop a Public Rail Transport Infos and Priority Seat Booking System (RailEase) that offer comprehensive all-in-one features to users, and verify or test the functionality of the developed system to ensure its operation runs as expected. After much time of consideration, the project has been decided to be developed with the prototyping model as it offers fast development. Various technologies, platforms and tools have been considered to be integrated in building this project, offering smooth features functioning for better user experience. User can book ticket, check schedules, get priority seats and get real-time train information efficiently. Therefore, the RailEase objective is archived as it surpassed the lack of convenient system provides on the public rail transport in Malaysia.</P>
